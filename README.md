# Housing Market Analysis and Forecast
### Some Features explanation:
Dollar_Volume:
This likely refers to the total value of all real estate transactions within a given period. It's calculated by multiplying the sale price of each property by the number of transactions. For example, if 10 houses were sold for $500,000 each, the dollar volume would be $5 million.

Average_SP_LP:
This stands for Average Sale Price to List Price ratio. It compares the sale price of a property to its original listing price. A value of 1 (or 100%) means that properties are selling for their list price, while a value above 1 means properties are selling for more than the list price, and below 1 means they are selling for less.

Average_DOM:
This stands for Average Days on Market. It represents the average number of days that properties in the dataset remain listed for sale before being sold. A lower average DOM indicates a faster market where properties are selling quickly, while a higher average DOM suggests slower sales.
